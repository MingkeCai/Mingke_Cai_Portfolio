## Introduction

I'm Mingke Cai, a passionate data enthusiast excited to share my journey with you. 
This repository showcases a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills in various aspects of data science, including:
- Data preprocessing
- Data analysis
- Data visualization
- Business analysis
- Statistical analysis

Most of my projects are implemented using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. 
I frequently utilize popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to derive insights and create compelling visualizations.

## Projects
Below you'll find brief summaries of each project in this portfolio. For more detailed information, please navigate to the respective project folders.

### 1.Crime Analysis and Prediction in NYC area
>This project analyzes NYC crime patterns using NYPD arrest data. Employing R for statistical, geospatial, and time series analysis, it reveals demographic disparities, 
>identifies crime hotspots, and examines temporal trends. Key outputs include interactive crime maps, demographic insights, and an ARIMA model for short-term crime 
>prediction. The study aims to inform data-driven law enforcement strategies, demonstrating the value of advanced analytics in urban crime prevention and resource allocation.

### 2.EV Rebate Program Impact Analysis
>This project analyzes New York State's Drive Clean Rebate program's impact on electric vehicle adoption and environmental benefits from 2017 to 2023. Using Python for data 
>analysis and visualization, we examined EV registration trends, rebate distributions, and their effects on emissions and petroleum consumption. Key findings include higher 
>market acceptance for lower rebates, Tesla's market dominance, and increasing cumulative environmental benefits despite decreasing per-vehicle efficiency. The analysis provides 
>insights to optimize rebate strategies for better EV adoption and environmental outcomes, demonstrating data science applications in sustainable transportation policy.

## Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope you find my projects interesting and informative!
