# Mingke Cai's Portfolio

## Introduction
Hello and welcome to my portfolio!

I'm Mingke Cai, a passionate data enthusiast excited to share my journey with you. 
This repository showcases a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills in various aspects of data science, including:
- Data preprocessing
- Data analysis
- Data visualization
- Business analysis
- Statistical analysis

Most of my projects are implemented using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. 
I frequently utilize popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to derive insights and create compelling visualizations.

## Projects
Below you'll find brief summaries of each project in this portfolio. For more detailed information, please navigate to the respective project folders.

### 1. Crime Analysis and Prediction in the NYC Area
>This project analyzes NYC crime patterns using NYPD arrest data. Employing R for statistical, geospatial, and time series analysis, it reveals demographic disparities, 
>identifies crime hotspots, and examines temporal trends. Key outputs include interactive crime maps, demographic insights, and an ARIMA model for short-term crime 
>prediction. The study aims to inform data-driven law enforcement strategies, demonstrating the value of advanced analytics in urban crime prevention and resource allocation.

### 2. EV Rebate Program Impact Analysis
>This project analyzes New York State's Drive Clean Rebate program's impact on electric vehicle adoption and environmental benefits from 2017 to 2023. Using Python for data 
>analysis and visualization, we examined EV registration trends, rebate distributions, and their effects on emissions and petroleum consumption. Key findings include higher 
>market acceptance for lower rebates, Tesla's market dominance, and increasing cumulative environmental benefits despite decreasing per-vehicle efficiency. The analysis provides 
>insights to optimize rebate strategies for better EV adoption and environmental outcomes, demonstrating data science applications in sustainable transportation policy.

### 3. CloudMatch: AWS-Powered Job Recommendation Engine
>CloudMatch is a cloud-based job recommendation system leveraging AWS technologies to bridge the gap between job seekers and employers in today's dynamic job market. Built on a 
>robust three-tier architecture, this system utilizes EC2 for backend processing, RDS for database management, and S3 for front-end hosting. It offers two key features: a skill-based 
>job search that provides tailored job recommendations, and a location-based job market analyzer that visualizes employment trends across cities. 
>By processing a dataset of 1.3 million LinkedIn job postings, CloudMatch demonstrates the power of cloud computing in handling large-scale data for practical applications. This 
>project not only showcases proficiency in AWS services, full-stack development, and data analysis, but also presents a scalable solution to real-world challenges in employment matching 
>and labor market insights.

### 4. Data-Driven Diabetes Care: Analyzing Social Determinants in Ontario's Public Health Units
>In this data-driven healthcare analytics project, I investigated the impact of social determinants on diabetes-related hospitalizations across Ontario's Public Health Units. Using Jupyter
>Notebook and Python libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and statsmodels, I conducted a comprehensive study of how factors such as residential instability, material
>deprivation, dependency, and ethnic concentration correlate with diabetes self-management outcomes. The project involved merging and analyzing datasets from Public Health Ontario,
>performing exploratory data analysis, and applying advanced statistical techniques.
>
>The core of this study was a hierarchical multiple regression analysis, sequentially adding ON-Marg factors to a base model that initially only considered the year. This approach revealed
>that social determinants collectively explained 44.9% of the variance in hospitalization rates, with material deprivation and ethnic concentration as the most significant predictors.
>Notably, areas of high ethnic concentration showed lower hospitalization rates, suggesting potential protective community factors. Based on these insights, I developed evidence-based
>policy recommendations to improve diabetes outcomes and reduce health disparities in Ontario. This project demonstrates my ability to apply advanced statistical methods to complex
>healthcare data, deriving actionable insights that can inform critical policy decisions.

### 5. E-commerce Analytics Pipeline & Dashboard System
>This end-to-end analytics solution transforms raw e-commerce data into actionable business insights through automated data processing and interactive visualization. The system handles >data from multiple platforms (Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal), implementing a complete ETL pipeline using Python and PostgreSQL, followed by comprehensive SQL analysis and Metabase dashboard >creation.
>
>The project features data cleaning and normalization scripts, database schema design, 30+ analytical SQL queries, and interactive dashboards tracking KPIs across sales, inventory, and >customer behavior. Key achievements include 30% reduction in stockout incidents, 15-20% revenue recovery from canceled orders, and optimized delivery operations based on regional >performance analysis. Technologies used include Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy), PostgreSQL, and Metabase for visualization.

### 6. Paper Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sensor Data
>Developed and implemented an advanced machine learning solution for a paper manufacturing company to predict and prevent paper quality issues using real-time sensor data. The project >analyzed over 500 sensor readings across various parameters (temperature, pressure, flow, speed, tank levels) to identify key correlations with paper quality. Using an ensemble approach >combining XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest models, achieved 87% accuracy in predicting paper quality issues, enabling proactive quality control and reducing waste.
>
>Enhanced the solution with a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning model for automated control, maintaining stable quality measures above rejection thresholds. >The project successfully identified the top 20 most influential sensors and provided actionable insights for process optimization, leading to potential reduction in rejection rates and >improved production efficiency. Built comprehensive data preprocessing pipelines, feature engineering techniques, and correlation analyses to handle complex industrial sensor data and >deliver robust predictions.
